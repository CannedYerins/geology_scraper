Geo I
An Overview of the Earth
Two principal classifications of what we need to discuss:
Materials and Processes
or
Stuff and What happens to it.
For the most part, the "stuff" is ROCK

What is Rock?
A generic definition: any naturally formed, firm, and coherent aggregate
mass of solid matter that constitutes part of a planet.
humm...what does this mean? Note this is trying to define something
more by saying what it isn't than what it is.
Naturally formed -> not man made
firm/coherent? -> not soil or sand (loose stuff)
aggregate mass of solid matter -> trying to exclude living things, but
note that organic material can be termed "rock" (like coal)
Part of a planet? -> not sure about this one; what about comets/meteors/
asteroids?
Is wood a rock? Why not?
Stone: A "small rock" or a "small piece of a rock"

The Internal Stucture of the Earth
To first order, the Earth is layered (radially symmetric)
 Large cutaway of Earth
 Current Image Earth Interior
 Current Ideas about Earth Interior
Why should this be? Two reasons:
Gravity / Density tends to stratify material
Convection  tends to homogenize
There are several depths within the Earth where material properties change
significantly over a short distance. These boundaries divide the Earth
into distinct zones. The most important of these are:
Crust: Upper few 10's of km
Mantle: ~2900 km depth
Core: to the center ~ 6371 km


===== overview_03.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
About the Crust:
Extremely heterogeneous (because we can see it?)
Well, maybe, but cold temperatures retard any mixing.
Basically two types:
Continental:
Light ( ~2.7 g/cm3)
Thick (10-70 km)
Can be very old (~ 4 Gyrs)
VERY COMPLICATED
Oceanic:
Heavy ( ~ 3 g/cm3)
Thin (6-10 km)
Young (0 - 200 My)
Quite simple (layered)


===== overview_04.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Main reasons for this difference have to do with plate tectonics:
Oceanic crust, being heavy and thin, is easily recycled into mantle
Continental crust, being thick an light, stays at the surface like scum
on a pond. Also, begin somewhat weak, it cruches up easily, which can lead
to big complications.
Note that the first geologists to find quantitative evidence for plate
tectonics were those who worked in the oceans.
The holdouts were all continental types.


===== overview_05.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
About the Mantle:
A significantly different chemical composition from the crust. The boundary
between the crust and mantle is often very sharp and is called the Mohorovicic
Discontinuity (or Moho for short).

Density (upper part) ~ 3.3 g/cm3

Much of the mantle CONVECTS because of the increase of temperature
with depth (like boiling water), which is why it is more homogeneous than
the crust.


===== overview_06.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
About the Core:
Mostly nickel and iron. Density (upper part) ~ 10 g/cm3

The boudary between the Core and Mantle (the CMB) is mostly spherical
but deviations as large as 20 km appear to exist (i.e., it is bumpy)
We divide the Core into an Outer part, known to be molten, and in Inner
part, known to be solid. The boundary between the inner and outer core
is at ~ 5140 km depth.
Recently, we have determined that the Inner Core of the Earth rotates
at a different rate than the rest of the Earth.
How do we know this?


===== overview_07.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Note the above classifications are based mostly on changes in composition.
A different, and equally important classification is made based on PHYSICAL
properties (e.g., how strong the materials are).
The main divisions are:
Lithosphere ~ 0 - 100 km depth
Asthenosphere ~ 100 - 350 km detph
Mesosphere ~ 350 ~ 2900 km depth
Outer Core ~ 2900 - 5140 km depth
Inner Core ~ 5140 - 6371 km depth (the center).
These properties are governed in large part by increases in temperature
and pressure within the Earth.

===== overview_08.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Lithosphere -
The "rock" (lithos) sphere - Strong rocks, approaching rigidity, deforming
brittley if at all. These are the "plates" of plate tectonics.

Note that the lithosphere include the crust and upper mantle.
As temperature increasese, the rocks start to loose strength and deform
plastically. When these happens we've reach the
Asthenosphere -
astheno = a - without + sthenos - strength.

This is the weak substrat upon which the plates ride.
Mesophere - Mostly a name for the rest of the mantle.
Outer Core -
molten
Inner Core -
Solid (because of great pressure, but this is also where the liquid outer core precipitates, so it is like a giant
crystal.)

Note that because of the uneven distribution of density, most of the
Earth's mass is within the Core! (We can deduce this from gross estimates
of the Earth's mass and volume).

GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Shape of the Earth
Question: What do do we mean by the Earth's "Shape"?
Related Question: Which way is up, and why?
The Earth's shape is governed for the most part by
Gravity, which pulls things in and
"Centrifugal force" which pushes things out
In the absence of other forces, a minimum energy configuration for a body
formed by gravity is a sphere.
The Earth is approximately spherical, but is flattened by rotation
Radius at poles: 6357 km
Radius at equator: 6378 km
Other factors influencing shape are from heterogeneities in the mantle.
These account for deviations on the order of 10's of meters or so.


===== overview_10.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
What's wrong with this statement:
"A man who weighs 90 kg at the equator weighs 90.5 kg at the North Pole"
The following could also be misunderstood:
"The ellipsoidal shape of the Earth corresponds approximately to the
surface of sea level. Indeed, if it is possible to calculate that if the
entire Earth were composed of water, it would be an ellipsoid of almost
identical shape".
Notes:
"Sea Level" corresponds to a surface called the GEOID, which is what scientists
use to define the "surface".
"if it is possible to calculate"? YES, IT IS POSSIBLE! Moreover, this was
done 200 years ago, and it was found that in fact the earth is flatter
than it would be if rocks had no shear strength!
Question: Is this surprising?
Consequences:
Rocks flow at low rates of strain
The Earth used to spin faster than it does today.

The Upper 100 Km (or so)
Distribution of Continental and Oceanic Crust
Generally, oceanic crust is beneath the ocean, and continental crust
isn't, BUT a fair amount of continental crust is below sea level.
Note the distribution of elevation of continental and oceanic crust.
Two things to note in particular:
Continental crust is at the higher elevations
There are two peaks in the distribution.


===== overview_12.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Why do you suppose this is?
Some numbers:
Oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface
Oceanic crust covers about 60%
The remaining 11% of underwater crust is continental.
NOTE: In terms of the crust, the ocean doesn't begin at water's edge, but
at a few 100 km away from shore. Just off shore is the
Continental Shelf, a nearly flat platform, which leads to the
Continental Slope, a more steeply dipping region, which leads to the
Continental Rise, a more gently dipping region where the ocean meets the
continent.
The Rise part is mostly ocean at depth, but is covered with sediments derived
from the shelf and slope.

So what is Plate Tectonics?
The current Geologic Paradigm for "How the World Works"
The basic idea: The Earth's surface is divided into a relatively small
number of "plates" that move laterally without suffering much internal
deformation.


===== overview_15.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
How did we get here? A brief history:
100 years ago, the prevailing theory about how the Earth evolved was
that the Earth was shrinking. Basic ideas:
Lord Kelvin and the cooling Earth (cold things contract)
Alpine Geologists and massive folded structures
Oceanic and continental crust was the same. Oceans formed when parts of
the crust caved in. (Land bridges were left so animals could wander from
place to place.
Some holes:
Western US Geologists (e.g., J.W. Powell) observe the crust going up over
time (e.g. Grand Canyon) and a lot of "extensional" geology.
NYC Geologists (Ewing) determine that oceanic crust is very different from
continental.
Nevertheless, most, if not all, geology was "vertical".
In the meantime, there was this guy Alfred Wegener who proposed "Continental
Drift". 
Why?
Similarity of coastlines of South America and Africa
Similarities in fossil record of different continents
Nobody bought it. No physics! Just how do you expect the continents to
plow through the oceans?!!
THEN during WWII, a lot of US navy in the Pacific. Harry Hess starts
mapping the large scale bathymetry of the oceans and takes note of the
ridge/plain/trench system, as well as the progressive evolution of seamounts.
He suggests that the oceans move laterally.
In the 60's, an explosion of research, all of which confirms this basic
idea of large scale lateral motion. Geology becomes "horizontal".
Evidence has always been indirect, so there have always been arguments
against this idea, especially from geologists who work on continents. Indeed,
the "rigid plate" idea doesn't work well at all in this type of environment.
However, today, with satellite navigation, we can measure horizontal
motion in real time! There is no doubt that large scale lateral motion
is real.


===== overview_16.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
What did Wegener miss?
The idea that continents are passive riders on larger plates. The plates
do not "plow around" each other but are created and consumed at ridges
and trenches. The Earth's crust recycles in the mantle!
The "plate" concept means that all of the slipping and deformation takes
place at the boundary between the plates. The interior is rigid. This idea
works pretty well for oceans but not so well for continents.


===== overview_17.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
The life of a plate:
Plate are created at "ridges" or "spreading centers". As plates move apart,
MAGMA (molten rock) from the mantle comes to the surface, cools, and makes
new plate.
As the plate cools, it gets thicker and more dense, and becomes deeper.
Because of convection the plate doesn't get any thicker than about 100
km, and so the oceans tend to "bottom out" at about 5 km depth.
Because oceanic plates are essentially just a colder version of the mantle
below, they are denser than the mantle and want to sink. Eventually they
do, and the boundary where the plate plunges back into the mantle is a
trench (or "subduction zone").
As it heats up, the cold oceanic plate is absorbed back into the mantle.


===== overview_18.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
What happens to continental crust?
Because it is less dense, continental crust is more difficult to subduct.
Some will reenter the mantle, but a lot of it will stay at the surface.
This is why the oldest rocks are continental.
When two continents come together, neither will subduct and the result
is a massive "collision" with the result being the formation of mountains.
The geologic term for this process is OROGENY.

GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
About boundaries: Plates can either
Pull apart or diverge (examples: ocean ridges, continental rifts)
View a Flash Movie about Plate Divergence.
Collide of converge 
(examples: trenches, 
Himalaya)
View a Flash Movie about Plate Convergence.
Slide past each other or "transform" (examples: San Andreas fault, Anatolian
fault, Mid Ocean transforms).
RATES: Typically a few cm/year. The Atlantic is spreading apart
at about the same rate as your fingernails grow.

Why is plate tectonics important?
It provides a quantitative framework for a large variety of Geologic
Observations. It shows how things are "tied together" and allows us to
make predictions about what will happen in the future.
It was so very successful that early practitioners were sure that we
would soon be able to do things like predict earthquakes. Not everything
is so easy, however.

Spheres of Influence

Hydrosphere
oceans, lakes, streams, groundwater, snow, ice, glaciers (cryosphere)
Atmosphere
air
Regolith
"blanket rock" ; the broken up bits of rock that lie on top of the
"bedrock". Transported regolith is "sediment". When bedrock pocks through
the regolith, it is called an exposure or "outcrop" (note the verb is "crops
out" NOT "outcrops")
Biosphere
All the organic stuff.

Cycles in the Spheres
Cycle - a sequence of recurring events. It really applies to
anything that is not linear, but repetitive. It does not have to mean something
circular, or even sequential (which makes the graphics a bit more difficult).
There are a LOT of cycles that are of importance in Earth Science. One
of the most important is (can you guess?) the
ROCK Cycle
 Tectonic Rock Cycle 
Basically, it's a balance between creation (tectonism) and destruction
(erosion). Here's how it works.
Take a rock, any rock.
Despite how durable rock looks, it eventually will wear down. Bits and
pieces of it will break off and wash away, becoming sediment.
When you accumulate a thick enough pile of sediment, heat and pressure
will solidify (or lithify or indurate) so it becomes massive enough. If
you don't melt the rock and don't mess with it too much, you wind up with
a sedimentary rock like sandstone, shale, or limestone.
If you bury it some more and really heat it and squeeze it the individual
grains will stretch and flow and you get a metamorphic rock.
If you go so far as to actually melt the rock, when it cools down again
you'll wind up with igneous rock. Of course, you can stretch igneous rock
so you wind up with different kinds of metamorphic rock.
Because of tectonism, all 3 types might eventually return to the surface,
where it will undergo the erosional process again.
So, no rock is forever, even diamonds. They all get recycled.
Rates? Extremely variable, but average age of continental rocks is 650
my, while for oceanic it is only 60 my.


===== overview_23.html =====


GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
Note that cycles exist for practically all materials. We pay closest
attention to the ones that are important for life. Here are a couple:
The Carbon Cycle
Four reservoirs:
Atmosphere (CO2)
Biosphere (organic compounds)
Hydrosphere (dissolved CO2 - like a soda!)
Rocks (limestone, coal, petroleum - hydrocarbons).
Some important actions for transferring from one reservoir to another:
Water -> dissolves CO2
Live Plants -> Take CO2 from atmosphere
Dead Plants -> Return it to the atmosphere or become part of rock
Animals -> Eat plant or use CO2 in water to make shells.
Rocks-> made from shells or from plants return CO2 to atmosphere
when they are eroded or burned.
The worry about the greenhouse effect and global warming is a consequence
of our taking enormous quantities of carbon out of the rock reservoir and
returning it to the Atmospheric reservoir.

GeoI Lecture Notes: Overview of the Earth
The Phosphorus Cycle
Typically, phosphorus is in limited supply but is essential for plant
growth. By introducing more phosphorus into the system, some plants like
algae can start to take off at the expense of other organisms. This is
the phenomenon of "eutorphication".
Other cycles of fundamental importance: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Water, Pop,
Motor.
Being aware of the cyclical nature of most phenomena is an important
step to understanding the balance of the environment.
Problem: These cycles may have periods that are far greater than our
ability to record directly. Others may have rates that vary over time,
or may be very sensitive to our own activities.

When Hutton Talks, People Listen
The recognition of very long term cycles was the major contribution
of James Hutton, sometimes called "the Father of Modern Geology". Basically
Hutton observed:
Marine fossils at high elevations (and at great distance from the sea)
Erosion taking its toll on the soil of his farm
Roman ruins that hadn't had much happen to them in several hundred years.
Hadrian's Wall
He concluded, if soil erodes, new soil must come from somewhere. Since
it doesn't rain soil, it must come from rock at higher elevations. The
rock at higher elevations appeared to have once been under water. Since
it takes so long for rock to decay, we must be looking at enormously long
periods of cycling.
Another big clue came from abrupt changes in sedimentary rocks:
Hutton's Unconformity
A central assumption to all this is UNIFORMITY; that the processes
in the past are pretty much like they are now. This is a good first order
guess, and has led to some important insights, but is not a "law". There
are a lot of exceptions to this (e.g., CO2 in atmosphere).
